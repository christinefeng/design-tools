> Download [Argon4](http://argonjs.io/argon-app) and the [Tutorial Source Code](https://github.com/argonjs/design-aids/tree/gh-pages/code). <br> This tutorial uses the *video* and *resources* directories.<br> **[Demo in Argon4](https://github.com/argonjs/design-aids/tree/gh-pages/code/video/)**


A-Frame itself has a [video primitive](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/primitives/a-video.html) that you can use to add video to a scene. To use it, you load the video as an asset and then position the video primitive into the scene. This same tag will work in Argon-aframe. It will play a video on a plane positioned in space. 

Try this in Argon:
{% highlight html %}
<ar-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <video id="myvideo" autoplay loop="true" src="xxx.mp4">
  </a-assets>
  <!-- Using the asset management system. -->
  <a-video src="#myvideo" width="16" height="9" position="0 0 -20"></a-video>
</ar-scene>
{% endhighlight %}

For audio, A-Frame has a sound component that you can attach to entities. See the [A-Frame documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.3.0/components/sound.html). This component should work on Argon-aframe just as it does in A-Frame. 

If these entities and components don't give you the capabilities that you need, you can also create your own component (see [lesson 12](http://argonjs.io/design-tools/aframe/part12/)) that can use the HTML audio and video tags to have more control over the presentation and interaction with the media. 

There are limitations to playing a video on iOS devices. See how A-Frame handles those limitations [here](https://aframe.io/docs/0.4.0/primitives/a-video.html).
